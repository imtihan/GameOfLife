# Game of Life Simulation

#
# Conway's Game of Life seeks to simulate some population behaviour by 4 basic rules, as follows
#   1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
#   2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
#   3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
#   4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
